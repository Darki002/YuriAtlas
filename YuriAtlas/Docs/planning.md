# Ideas to Implement

A few Ideas that could be interesting to implement. Ideas form ChatGPT based on:

    I have a spreadsheet with a list of Mangas with the following Data:

    -Title	
    -Alternative Title
    -(N)SFW (No, Suggestive, Erotic, NSFW)
    -Genres
    -Format	(Manga, Long Strip, Webtoon, Doujinshi, Light Novel, etc.)
    -Publicaion (Complete, On Going, Cancelled, On Hold)
    -Link to wear you can read it

    In Python I managed to read the data from the google spreadsheet. 

    **Current Plans**
    1. Filter Options for Name, Genres, etc.
    2. NSFW Switch

    **Question**
    What else could I do. I want to learn Python for Data Science and Machin Learning. So what basic things could I do with this data to display, manipulate, or work with user inputs, to learn that, based on what I currently have.
    It can be somethig like Diffrent Charts, A recomendation machine (makes a recomendation based on user input), or what ever comes to mind. Come up with some ideas.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate summary statistics for your dataset.
Create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, or histograms to understand the distribution of genres, formats, publication status, etc.
Explore the relationships between different variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.


## User-Interactive Dashboard:

Build a simple dashboard using tools like Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit where users can filter and explore the data visually.


## Recommendation System:

Implement a basic content-based recommendation system. Given a manga title or genre as input, recommend other titles based on similarities in genres, formats, or other features.


## Text Analysis:

Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze manga titles and alternative titles. You can perform sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, or even build a word cloud to visualize common terms.


## NSFW Classification:

Build a machine learning model to classify NSFW levels based on the given data. Use features like title, alternative title, and genres to predict the NSFW category. This could be a binary classification problem (NSFW or not).


## Interactive Filtering and Sorting:

Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to filter and sort the manga list based on different criteria such as genres, publication status, or NSFW levels.


## Time Series Analysis:

If your dataset includes publication dates, you can perform time series analysis to observe trends in manga releases over time.


## Clustering Analysis:

Apply clustering algorithms to group similar manga based on features like genres, formats, or publication status. Visualize the clusters and explore the characteristics of each group.


## Collaborative Filtering:

If you have user data (e.g., ratings if users have read the manga), you can explore collaborative filtering techniques for more advanced recommendation systems.


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Work on handling missing values, correcting inconsistent data, or normalizing text data. Proper data cleaning is crucial for effective analysis and modeling.
Remember to document your code and analyses as you work through these projects. This will help you understand the reasoning behind your decisions and make it easier for others (or yourself) to follow your work.
